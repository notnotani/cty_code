	<h2>Zakir Hussain</h2> <br><br><br>
	<p>Zakir Hussain was born on March 9th, 1951 in Mumbai. He learned tabla from his father, Alla Rakha. He is
appreciated both in the field of percussion and in the music world at large as an international phenomenon.
A classical tabla virtuoso of the <a target="_blank" href="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ac/ba/63/acba638d2730c2db2a38afaac8f59351.jpg"><img src="zakir2.jpg" class="maestros" style="width: 5%; height: 5%; float: right; padding: 5px" ></a>highest order, his  consistently brilliant and exciting performances have not
only established him as a national treasure in India, but gained him worldwide fame. He has been the favorite
accompanist to most of India’s greatest classical musicians and dancers. His playing is marked by uncanny
intuition and masterful improvisational dexterity, founded in profound knowledge and study. As a child prodigy, Zakir Hussain was touring by the age of 12. He first came to the United States in 1970. He performs all over the world throughout the year. He has composed and recorded innumerable albums
and soundtracks, and has received widespread recognition as a composer for his many ensembles and
collaborations. He has composed soundtracks for the films “In Custody,” Ismail Merchant’s directorial debut,
“Little Buddha” by Bernardo Bertolucci, for which Zakir Hussain composed, performed and acted as Indian
music advisor, and “Vanaprastham,” chosen to be screened at the Cannes Film Festival in May, 1999.</p><br><br><br>
	<h2>Ahmedjan Thirakawa</h2><br><br><br>
	<p>Ahmedjan Thirakawa was born in 1891 or 1892 in Muradabad, Uttar Pradesh. His father, Hussain Baksh
Khan, was a famous Sarangi and tabla player, and his uncle, Sher Khan, was a reputed tabla player. On his
mother’s side, his grandfather Kalander <a target="_blank" href="https://img.discogs.com/JFpbG2HytonvRc6GOxqlhsGVUwA=/170x268/smart/filters:strip_icc():format(jpeg):mode_rgb():quality(90)/discogs-images/A-698538-1269555340.jpeg.jpg"><img src="ahmedjan.jpg" class="maestros" style="width: 5%; height: 5%; float: left; padding: 5px" ></a>Baksh Khan and uncles Faiyaz Khan and Baksh Khan were also well
known tabla players. This implies that he was born in an atmosphere of tabla. His father and uncle initiated
him into tabla. Later he also received guidance from his two maternal uncles.
Seeing his talent, his family sent him to Meerut to study tabla with Munir Khan, the doyen of the Delhi and
Farrukhabad gharanas. Ahmedjan studied with Munir Khan from the age of 12 until he was 40 years old.
During this period he lived with his master, away from home, following a rigorous schedule of practice and
related activities which included even wrestling. He was completely focused on tabla, and there was no
diversion of any sort. He was not permitted by Munir Khan to perform alone until the age of 39.
In search of job opportunities, Ahmedjan came to Mumbai and joined the theater run by Baal Gandharv as
a staff musician, where he worked for a number of years. He also taught at the Marris College of Music in
Lucknow, and later became a court musician in Rampur. As recognition of his extraordinary musicianship he
was awarded “Sangeet Martand” by Sangeet Bharathi in Kanpur; “Aftab-e-Mausiki” by Allahabad University
and finally “Padmabhusan” by the Government of India. Seeing the restlessness of his fingers on the tabla,
Abdul Aziz Khan called him ‘Thirakawa’.</p><br><br><br>
	<h2>Alla Rakha</h2><br><br><br>
	<p>Alla Rakha was the leading representative of the Punjab gharana in the second half of the 20th century.
He was born in Ratangarh village,<a target="_blank" href="https://www.thegarspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Abbaji.jpg"><img src="alla.jpg" class="maestros" style="width: 5%; height: 5%; float: right; padding: 5px" ></a> Gurudaspur District of Punjab and later settled in Mumbai. This
happened before Independence in 1947.
From his early childhood Alla Rakha showed a natural inclination towards music, which he must have acquired
from a previous life. In childhood he joined a roaming drama company, and at the age of 15 started learning tabla
from Laal Mohammad Khan, who was a disciple of Kader Baksh Khan. Later he had the opportunity to listen to
Kader Baksh Khan in Lahore and he immediately became his Ganda-Bandh disciple. He lived with his master for
a few years. After that he started traveling and performing in music festivals all over the subcontinent.
He was employed by All India Radio in Mumbai as an accompanist and worked in that capacity until 1942.
During this period he made connections with the Hindi film industry and composed music for movies under
the name A.R. Qureshi.
He was brought to the west by Ravi Shankar as his accompanist, which first brought him world-wide recognition. Over
the course of time he visited many countries with other musicians as well, and became the most well-known of all tabla
players. Alla Rakha’s playing was marked by dexterity, spontaneity and intelligence. He died on February 3rd, 2000, in
Mumbai at the age of 81. His sons Zakir Hussain, Fazal Qureshi and Taufiq Qureshi are keeping his music alive.</p><br><br><br>
	<h2>Amir Hussain Khan</h2><br><br><br>
	<p>Amir Hussain Khan was born in 1899 in Banakhanda, Meerut, in a musical atmosphere. His father was a
Sarangi player in the court of the<a target="_blank" href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/uwjBNZe5OmE/hqdefault.jpg"><img src="amir.jpg" class="maestros" style="width: 5%; height: 5%; float: left; padding: 5px" ></a> Nizam of Hyderabad. His maternal uncle was the famous tabla maestro
Munir Khan. Munir Khan used to visit his sister in Hyderabad, and the young Amir Hussain took the opportunity to begin
his lessons in tabla with this real master. Later, as he grew in age and passion, Amir Hussain Khan moved to
Mumbai to be with his ustad. Eventually, he started traveling with Munir Khan to Baroda, Delhi, Meerut
when his ustad had performances there. Munir Khan was also a court musician for the King of Raigarh. At
one point Munir Khan arranged for Amir Hussain Khan to be invited to Raigarh to perform for the King. His
impressive performance earned him rewards from the ruler. He spent the later part of his life in Mumbai
teaching and performing. Amir Hussain Khan was well respected for his knowledge, compositional skill and down-to-earth personality.
Khansahab was an excellent teacher and has left behind a few disciples, who in their turn have made
valuable contributions to the field of tabla. They include Pandarinath Nageshkar, Nikhil Ghosh, Arvind
Mulgaonkar, and Babasaheb Mirajkar among many others. He died on January 5th, 1969 in Mumbai.</p><br><br><br>
