	<p>This piece is called a "rela" which derives from the English word "rail". This implies that the piece is very fast and contains precise hand movements. This was performed by Bickram Ghosh at the popular Darbar festival in 2015.</p><br>

	<p>This piece is interesting in its refusal to not follow a particular structure. It, however, shows off the various sounds of the tabla and how they can be manipulated to evoke certain emotions in people. This is also a recently performed piece, being performed by the great Shahbaz Hussain in 2015.</p><br>

	<p>This gem from 1992 shows off the incredible harmony that can be achieved when a tabla is but together with a string instrument like the <i>sarangi</i>. The two players, Ustad Miyan Shaukat Hussain Khan Sahib on tabla and Ustad Sultan Khan on the sarangi take turns going back and forth, building up to the climx at the end.</p><br>
