			<b> Here are some lyrics from a favorite song by the late, great <i> Harry Chapin </i> </b>

  Flowers are red </b>
	<br>
  The little boy went first day of school
  He got some crayons and started to draw
  He put colors all over the paper
  For colors was what he saw
  And the teachers said.. What you doin' young man
  I'm paintin' flowers he said
  She said... It's not the time for art young man
  And anyway flowers are green and red
  There's a time for everything young man
  And a way it should be done
  You've got to show concern for everyone else
  For you're not the only one
  <br>
  And she said...
  Flowers are red young man
  Green leaves are green
  There's no need to see flowers any other way
  Than the way they have always been seen
  <br>
  But the little boy said...
  There are are so many colors in the rainbow
  So many colors in the morning sun
  So many colors in the flower and I see every one
  ...
